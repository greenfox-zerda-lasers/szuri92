           <p>Margaret Heafield Hamilton (born August 17, 1936)[1] is a computer scientist,
             systems engineer and business owner. She was Director of the Software Engineering
             ivision[2] of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight
             software for the Apollo space program.[3] In 1986, she became the founder and CEO
             of Hamilton Technologies, Inc., in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed
             around the Universal Systems Language based on her paradigm of Development Before the Fact
             (DBTF) for systems and software design.[4]
           </p>

           <p>Hamilton has published over 130 papers, proceedings, and reports about
           the 60 projects and six major programs in which she has been involved.

         <h2>Early Life</h2 >
        <p>Margaret Heafield was born in Paoli, Indiana to Kenneth Heafield and
           Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).[5] After graduating from Hancock
           High School in 1954, she started out in mathematics at the University of
           Michigan and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in philosophy from
           Earlham College in 1958.[6][7] She briefly taught high school mathematics
           and French upon graduation, in order to support her husband while
           he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard, with the ultimate
           goal of pursuing a graduate degree at a later time. She moved to
           Boston, Massachusetts with the intention of doing graduate study
           in abstract mathematics at Brandeis University. In 1960 she took
           an interim position at MIT to develop software for predicting
           weather on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1 computers (at Marvin Minsky's
           Project MAC) for professor Edward Norton Lorenz in the meteorology
           department.[8][1][9] Hamilton wrote that at that time, computer
           science and software engineering were not yet disciplines; instead,
           programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.[3]
         </p>
         <p>
           From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the SAGE Project at Lincoln Lab,
           where she was one of the programmers who wrote software for the first
           AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1), to search for "unfriendly" aircraft;
           she also wrote software for the Air Force Cambridge Research
           Laboratories.

           <h2>SAGE Project</h2>
          <p>The SAGE Project was an extension of Project Whirlwind, started by
             MIT, to create a computer system that could predict weather systems
             and track their movements through simulators; SAGE was soon developed
             for military use in anti-aircraft air defense from potential Soviet
             attacks during the Cold War. For her part, Hamilton described her
             duties as such,

               What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner,
               was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever figure
               out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well.
               And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person
               who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments were
               in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually
               got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek.
               I was the first one to get it to work.[10]

          <p>Hamilton then joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT,
             which at the time was working on the Apollo space mission.
             She eventually led a team credited with developing the software
             for Apollo and Skylab.[11] Hamilton's team was responsible for developing
             in-flight software,[12] which included algorithms designed by
             various senior scientists for the Apollo command module, lunar lander,
             and the subsequent Skylab.[3][13] Another part of her team designed
             and developed the systems software [14] which included the error
             detection and recovery software such as restarts and the Display
             Interface Routines (AKA the Priority Displays) which Hamilton
             designed and developed.[15] She worked to gain hands-on experience
             during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and
             software engineering courses did not exist.[3]
           </p>
           <p>Her areas of expertise include systems design and software
              development, enterprise and process modelling, development paradigm,
              formal systems modeling languages, system-oriented objects for
              systems modelling and development, automated life-cycle
              environments, methods for maximizing software reliability and
              reuse, domain analysis, correctness by built-in language properties,
              open-architecture techniques for robust systems, full life-cycle
              automation, quality assurance, seamless integration, error detection
              and recovery techniques, man-machine interface systems, operating
              systems, end-to-end testing techniques, and life-cycle management
              techniques.[3][16]

            <h3>Apollo 11</h3>
            <p>In one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the
               Apollo Guidance Computer together with the on-board flight software
               averted an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before
               the Lunar lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer
               alarms were triggered. The computer was overloaded with interrupts
               caused by incorrectly phased power supplied to the lander's rendezvous
               radar.[17][18][4] The program alarms indicated "executive overflows",
               meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its tasks in
               real time and had to postpone some of them.[19] The asynchronous
               executive designed by J. Halcombe Laning [17][20] allowed the computer
               to cope with the increased demand by prioritizing tasks. Hamilton's priority
               alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays to warn them
               that there was an emergency “giving the astronauts a go/no go decision
               (to land or not to land)”.[21] Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer
               in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented
               to the astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, "Go, go!"
               And on they went.”[22] Dr. Paul Curto, senior technologist who nominated
               Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called Hamilton's work "the foundation
               for ultra-reliable software design."[14]
               <div class="padded">
                 <p>The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough
                    to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks
                    than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm,
                    which meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks
                    than I should be doing at this time and I'm going to keep only
                    the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing
                    ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize
                    error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated
                    into the software. The software's action, in this case, was to eliminate
                    lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ...
                    If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery
                    action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon
                    landing it was.[23]

                <h2>Business</h2>
                <p>From 1976 through 1984, Hamilton was the CEO of a
                   company she co-founded called Higher Order Software (HOS)
                   to further develop ideas about error prevention and fault
                   tolerance emerging from her experience at MIT.[25] They created
                   a product called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology developed
                   at MIT.[26][27][28] It was successfully used in numerous government
                   projects.[29][30] One notable project was to formalize and implement
                   the first computable IDEF, C-IDEF for the Air Force, based on HOS as
                   its formal foundation[citation needed].
                 </p>
                 <p>
                   The HOS methodology garnered little interest except among
                   consultants associated with the company.[31] An evaluation
                   conducted by the United States Navy concluded, "the HOS
                   literature tends to advertise their ideas and products more than
                   making a contribution in substance to the field of Computer
                   Science."[31] Edsgar Dijkstra described the USE.IT software
                   as "mechanized aids for the application of obsolete techniques.
                   "[32] A detailed analysis of the HOS theory and AXES language was
                   used by Harel to develop a derived language for a more modern
                   form of structured programming derived from HOS called the And/Or
                   programming language from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals.[33]
                   Referring to Dijkstra's classic work on structured programming,
                   Harel states: “As will become clear, the "layers" in which
                   the program is arranged, these being in the heart of the idea
                   of structured programming, correspond to the levels of the tree.”
                   Harel goes on to show at that time how HOS and his derived
                   And/Or programming language relates to mathematical logic,
                   game theory and artificial intelligence. Others have used HOS
                   to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers [34] and
                  to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems[35]

                <p>Hamilton left the company, HOS, in 1985. In March 1986,
                   she became the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies,
                   Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed
                   around the Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated
                   automated environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm
                   of Development Before The Fact (DBTF) for systems design and software
                   development.[4][36][37][38]

                <p>When Hamilton started using the term "software
                   engineering",[39][40][41] software engineering was not taken
                   seriously compared to other engineering; nor was it regarded
                   as a science. She began to use the term "software engineering"
                   during the early Apollo missions in order to give software the
                   legitimacy of other fields such as hardware engineering. Over
                   time the term "software engineering" has gained the same respect
                   as any other discipline.[42] "At MIT she assisted in the creation
                   of the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her
                   colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer".[43]
                   Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important
                   role in getting man to the moon. Hamilton, along with many other
                   female engineers alike, challenged the male dominated technology
                   field of their time, to allow for women to enter in these STEM fields
                  for many years to come.[44]

                <h3>Awards</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><span>In 1986, she received the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award by the
                    Association for Women in Computing.[6] This award is given to
                    individuals who have excelled in either (or both) of two areas:
                    1. Outstanding scientific and technical achievement and 2.
                    Extraordinary service to the computing community through their
                    accomplishments and contributions on behalf of women in computing.[45]
                  </span></li>
                  <li><span>In 2003, she was given the NASA Exceptional Space Act Award
                     for scientific and technical contributions. The award included
                     $37,200, the largest amount awarded to any individual in NASA's
                     history.[14][46][47]
                  </span></li>
                  <li><span>In 2009, she received the Outstanding Alumni Award by Earlham
                      College.[6]
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, in 2016 a Lego minifigure of her was proposed.[48]</p>

                <h2>Personal life</h2>
                <p>She met her husband James Cox Hamilton while at Earlham College.
                   They married in the late 1950s after Heafield earned her
                    bachelor's degree. They had a daughter together named Lauren,
                    who, later in her life, married the billionaire heir, actor,
                    dancer, and choreographer James Cox Chambers. During the
                    weekends she would often take Lauren to the lab to spend
                    time with her daughter and simultaneously "code away creating
                    routines that would later be added to Apollo's command module
                    computer".[43] Margaret Hamilton and James Cox Hamilton
                    eventually divorced.[49]
